# Express App Deployment

This is a working API that needs to be deployed.

* Add and configure a PostgreSQL driver for production
  * Note that the app should still use SQLite locally
* Create a production environment with a database
* Deploy the API to the production environment
* Migrate and seed the production database

Verify that the app works. A properly configured app should respond to `GET /dogs` and `GET /owners`.
